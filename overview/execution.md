# 🏋️‍♂️ Execution

We rely on three main principles to achieve our goals:

1. **Incentivize Community Contributions:**\
   Reward ecosystem contributions, including content creation, tool development, event organization, and more.
2.  **Uplift Community Leaders:**\
    Select a group of outstanding individuals to help shape the initiative and serve as role models for

    community contributions.
3. **Iterate & Experiment:**\
   Refine initiative through relentless experimentation and accelerate development through a fast iteration.
