# ðŸ‘‹ Get Involved

If you are new to MultiversX, the best place to start is to simply getting involved in the ecosystem. There is no right or wrong way to do this: Ask a question, make a suggestion, host an event, create a wallet for your mother! The possibilities are endless.

Check our [Framework for Action](https://medium.com/@xAlliance/a-framework-for-action-58a96df36210), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xAllianceDAO), browse our [website](https://www.xalliance.io), hang out with us on [Discord](https://www.discord.xalliance.io), stay up to date in on our Telegram channel (soon), [explore the ecosystem](https://multiversx.com/ecosystem). Join us.

And, of course: If you have any questions, [feel free to reach out](get-in-touch.md)!
