# ðŸ©µ Core Values

:handshake: **Communication & Collaboration:** We communicate openly and invite constructive feedback. If we can improve, we will improve. We believe in cooperation and knowledge-sharing among community members, partners, and stakeholders. We go far (and fast), together.

:muscle: **Community Empowerment:** We provide resources, support, and opportunities so individuals and projects can thrive within the ecosystem. Catalyzing growth, from the bottom up.

:bulb: **Innovation & Ingenuity:** We explore new ideas, methods, and approaches. We embrace the possibility of failure. If we fail, we'll fail a little better each time.

:woman\_running: **Long-term thinking:** We don't focus on short-term results. We create today what will make a difference tomorrow.
